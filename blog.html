                                Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the function where they are declared. <br>
                                var variables are hoisted to the top of their scope, which means you can use them before they are declared in the code. <br>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Variables declared with let are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the block (like loops or if statements) where they are declared. <br>
                                let variables are not hoisted to the top of their scope, and they are not accessible before the declaration. <br>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Variables declared with const are also block-scoped. <br>
                                Unlike var and let, const variables cannot be reassigned after they are declared. <br>
                                However, the value they hold is not necessarily immutable. If a const variable holds an object or array, the properties or elements of that object or array can still be changed. <br>

                                null. is a special value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. <br>
                                It is often explicitly assigned to variables or properties by developers to signify the absence of a meaningful value. <br>
                            </p>

                                undefined. is a primitive value that is automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not initialized. <br>
                                It is also the default return value of a function that does not explicitly return anything. <br>
                                When accessing an object property or array element that doesn't exist, the result is undefined. <br>

                                REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of architectural principles for designing networked applications. It is an architectural style that uses a set of constraints and principles to build scalable and stateless web services. RESTful APIs are widely used in web development to enable communication between systems on the internet.
